- Note that the split line style is in the comments. If you feel that the split line style suits you better, you can change the comment manually.

# 4 table

- Rendering:

# 5 line_height

- Function: Adjusts the line spacing/title spacing, etc. in preview mode and edit mode.
- Rendering: This is not very convenient to show, you can use and feel for yourself.
